# Using Terraform to manage GitHub Actions

This repository hosts the Terraform HCL written during my project to manage GH Actions.

This is the second part of project: the [first](https://github.com/trmatthe/kibble-on-aws) was building the new site
infra, and this is about auto-publishing my articles.

I am always happy to get feedback.
